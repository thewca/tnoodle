### Fixed
+seeding scrambles doesn't work
+format scramble source better
+importing scrambles window doesn't fit
+scramble shouldn't be on top of fullscreen or importing scrambles windows
+import scramble window is on top of fullscreen timer
+scramble automove doesn't save location
	+apply more often than just resizing the window?
+scramble autosizing causes a bit of lag on the timer...
+table should force its resizing up to the layout manager
+tapping space right after stopping timer turns green & 0.00, even though the timer can't run yet
+formatting +2 penalties doesn't work
	+saving DNF/+2 doesn't seem to work...
+switching session with imported scrambles would ask if you wanted to clear the imported scrambles
+make times columns hideable, consolidate that code, add tooltips
	+getValueCenties -> just centis...
+don't let the scramble grow too large!
+TimesTable
	+addtime grows the add time row
	+weird stuff happens with extremely large times
	+hovering to penalize/tag times...
+1 line scrambles shouldn't get oddly spaced
+cannot call split of undefined when getting scramble & server is down
+sizing of table columns option is odd in chrome, fixed with nasty workaround
+selecting multiple times shows X on all times
+tagging div doesn't disappear in FF
+best session ave is colored, what's the point?
	+same goes for some of the other columns
+fix file permissions
+tagging doesn't default correctly
+!!!comments aren't being positioned nicely in chrome on os X
+Xbrowser stuff
	+keyDown only gets called once on ff, makes sense
	+select dropdown styling...
    +scramble doesn't wrap on opera
    +opera keyboard shortcuts are iffy, fixed as best as possible
        +apparently opera binds all sorts of crap, like ctrl+z, ctrl+y, but they're blocked when in a text field. This means that a user can configure ctrl+z as a shortcut, but when they try to use it, they won't be focused on a text box, so opera goes and does its thing. Maybe there's a solution here that involves focusing the user on an invisible text box and listening to events there, lol
+added medians
+configurable columns
	+add gui for this!
+ +/- looks like an underlined plus sign. Buttons? Like the AA buttons in rich text editors?
	+scratch that idea, instead, automatically make the scramble fit
+load scramble once timer has started to reduce lag
+"3x3 session started..." should become a dropdown box, remove old box
+esc to get rid of import scrambles window
+undo redo
	+maintain scramble list! urghhhh
+add space between table and scrambles (leyan)
+auto scroll should show the add time row!
+save scramble view state on a per customization basis
+0.00 when keys down now reflects the update frequency
+wca style penalties
+get consensus on what the hell a session average is!
	+add new session average!
	+stdev is the standard deviation of times, not session averages
+big scramble view is blurry (pedro)
+fixed bug where resizing scramble image could make it permanently too big
+improve behavior of update freq option
+need a favicon.ico!
+always manual time entry a la qqtimer
+scramble position not being saved
+build script should read version from other build script?
+solve/session comments
	+session comments & probably solve comments not being saved
	+session comments -> tab name?
	+need the exact dates of sessions somewhere
+times table needs to gracefully scale down to 1 column, else there's no point in making the columns configurable
	+vertically align penalty labels with radio buttons
	+error message when adding time can get in the way
	+icons for "Reset" and "Download" links
+twitter style hashtags in comments
+ensure that times table is wide enough for all 3 selects
+sq1 scramble spacing: only pad if it can be done in <= 3 spaces
+show some details on the currently selected solve?
	+how about an "import scramble" link?
+holding down space and then tapping "n" gives odd behavior - fixed
+pgup pgdown should scroll the times table
+BOLD for "Edit" and "New session"
+ =) ***** SYSTEM TO CHANGE PUZZLE/EVENT OF CURRENT SESSION *****

	+find a place to use the icons...custom <select> with support for icons
+add a "new session" icon
+shortcuts menu on gerty doesn't work
+configurable length wca style inspection? apparently some people use this
+build problems
	+A uses B, A & B are built, B changes (A doesn't), now we compile A and nothing happens (silly optimization of the ant java task)!
	+FIX MINIFICATION (by reverting to old jslint, lol)
	+optimize git commit hook to only jslint when a .js file has been modified
	+sometimes index.html,tnt.js,tnt.css get clobbered by ant build =(
	+ant, ant -> the second call does nothing! =)
	+get rid of Main-Class from jars that don't need them
	+uncompiled jcubeexplorer doesn't work, tables don't get saved?
+pressing escape to close tnoodle popup doesn't restore focus
+background image/opacity
+thread safety! this must be done before giving to the WCA
+fmc generation
+cleanup readme.textile & root html (just add name, lol)
+Tac style error catching + pdb
+save twophase tables to file & load on startup
+ensure twophase code is both thread safe and thread fast, perhaps keep a ThreadLocal<Search> inside of CubeScrambler?
+importing a tnt scramble DOES NOT freaking work!, reimporting scramble with a lot of spaces...?
+keyboard shortcuts now say keys(c) when configured? this must have changed with the new mootools

+adjusting brightness rapidly starts and stops the timer
	+opening laptop lid also starts the timer
+ctrl+a/select all doesn't work inside of stats field
+holding down keys w/ inspection on shows 0.00, which doesn't really make sense
+clicking to view the RA of an already selected time makes it editable
+reset timer shortcut
+true fullscreen?
	-esc-ing out of fullscreen in firefox screws up timer font
	+leaving fullscreen screws up the scrolling of the times table
+pressing escape right after loading TNT causes an exception
+pressing escape to close a dialog causes the reset shortcut to fire
+pressing esc while commenting on a session doesn't stop propagation of the event
+clicking on ave100 does something even when there is no ave100
+add time "dnf" -> cannot call savesessions of 
+replace all issue with time stats?
+esc doesn't close time comment
+resetting format str doesn't seem to work
+shift/ctrl select times starts timer on windows because ctrl and shift keyrepeat
+tmt.createPopup hide() should give the timer focus

-push mootools fixes upstream (https://github.com/mootools/mootools-more/pull/1082 & https://github.com/mootools/mootools-more/pull/1083)
	+change to keyboard to support stuff like "a+;" this is needed for stackmat keyboard emulation configuration
	-mootools-core DOMEvent if(keydown) statement? (https://github.com/GCheung55/mootools-core/commit/ef7e091874c80efe9aa5a039fe75798398e19e46)
	-Chrome Element vs mootools Element for fullscreen api
-pretty gui for editing
	-create an editable table superclass for the editable list & times table
-read times/metronome

-add remaining stackmat options
-provide some system for uploading your own image?
-top row of times table shouldn't wrap
-get rid of multiple drop down arrows?
-scrambles for arbitrary relays?
-sign in link needs to do something, or go away
-behave nicely when the server goes down
	-exponential backoff for "Loading Scramble..."
	-make import scramble offline safe
	-look at all ajax calls!
	-be good about cancelling pending ajax calls
	-use global status bar to indicate pending ajax requests
-rewrite config stuff
	-separate defaults from running code

### webscrambles
+#5 incremental clock scrambles don't show pin positions

-rounds named "seed" or "showIndices"
-infinite seeded scrambles
-#6 configurable clock colorscheme

-richer heirarchy of scrambles (2gen, LL, reese, whatever...)
-scramble hints? such as cross...

### server/utils
-create own java assertions facility, as java assertions cannot be enabled at runtime
	-check at commit time that everything uses azzert instead of assert
	-find some way of printing out the contents of the assertion that blew up

-saving times
	-Add a note about opening multiple instances of tnt
		-screw this, just store everything in the db, and make it easy to create an account
	-add login
	-implement stuff on scratch paper!!!
	-graphs (save for Hackathon2011?)
-add autoupdating to server

### webscrambles-ui
-shelley's gui (https://github.com/jfly/tnoodle/issues?labels=webscrambles-ui)

### TNoodleMakeTools
+load everything from file! extract all to a folder on first startup, note that this does break java applets, but that's ok, nobody cares =(
	+plugins/scramble icons
+consolidate context file/short name/long name for scramble plugins
+injectable analytics js?

-Need some way of running "tmt make check" after every change. I think it's too painful to run it before every commit. Perhaps it would be best to have the server run make check before starting up, and fail to start (or start up an old version?) if make check fails? This would certainly force people to fix their test failures.
