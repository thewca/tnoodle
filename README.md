There is no limitation in the use of this software other than the following:  If you're using my code, original or modificated, 
you are obliged to show somewhere "based on an idea and code by Luis J. Iáñez".  If your page shows credits, I must appear 
on them.

I estimate that only 60-70% of my original idea is already implemented.  If you're considering to derivate my code, maybe
you should wait a bit.
