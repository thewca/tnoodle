TNoodle is really a collection of projects. Each project can be treated as a full fledged Eclipse project (they each have a .classpath and .project file). Furthermore, the whole tnoodle directory can be opened as an Eclipse workspace. Simply go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace, and enter your tnoodle directory under "Select root directory". Eclipse should automagically detect all the tnoodle projects.

TODO - git submodule init ?

* jcubeexplorer: A wrapper for Herbert Kociemba's excellent Java implementation of the 2-phase algorithm to save its tables to disk. This shaves the ~10 seconds normally spent starting up down to a fraction of a second. The original source is available here: http://kociemba.org/cube.htm

* scrambles: A Java scrambling suite. Java applications can use this project as a library, a perfect example of this is tnoodleserver.

* server: A basic, estensible webserver.

that serves up scrambles, scramble images, and tnoodletimer.

* stackmat: A Java library that parses a Stackmat plugged into an audio port.

* timer: A Javascript Rubik's Cube timer.

* tools: The location for utilities used to develop tnoodle.

* utils: Useful Java functions used throughout tnoodle.
